## 🔧 System Architecture

```
SecureEye Device → TCP/IP → Biometric Listener → Integration Service → Database
                                      ↓
Frontend Dashboard ← REST API ← Controller ← Integration Service
```

## 📋 Quick Start Guide

### 1. Database Setup
```bash
npm run biometric:setup
```

### 2. Configure Environment
```env
ENABLE_BIOMETRIC=true
BIOMETRIC_PORT=8080
BIOMETRIC_HOST=0.0.0.0
```

### 3. Start System
```bash
# Option A: Integrated with main app
npm run start:with-biometric

# Option B: Separate biometric service
npm run biometric:start
```

### 4. Configure SecureEye Device
- **Server IP**: Your computer's IP address
- **Port**: 8080 (or your configured port)
- **Mode**: TCP/IP real-time transmission
- **Format**: Enable enrollment and access modes

### 5. Enroll Members
1. Go to **Biometric** section in admin dashboard
2. Select member without biometric data
3. Click **"Enroll Fingerprint"**
4. Follow on-screen instructions
5. Member scans finger multiple times as prompted

## 📱 How It Works

### Member Check-in Flow
```
1. Member places finger on scanner
2. Device sends biometric data to server
3. System looks up member by biometric ID
4. Checks active membership plan
5. Logs attendance (check-in or check-out)
6. Sends response to device
7. Displays welcome/goodbye message
```

### Enrollment Flow
```
1. Admin selects member in dashboard
2. System enters enrollment mode
3. Device prompts for finger scans
4. Multiple scans captured for accuracy
5. Biometric ID assigned to member
6. Enrollment logged in database
7. Member can now use biometric access
```

## 🎯 Supported Message Formats

Your system handles multiple SecureEye message formats:

### JSON Format
```json
{
  "userId": "12345",
  "status": "authorized",
  "deviceId": "DEVICE001",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### CSV Format
```
12345,2024-01-15T10:30:00Z,authorized,DEVICE001
```

### Custom Format
```
USER:12345:AUTHORIZED:DEVICE001
```

### Enrollment Messages
```
ENROLL:12345:John Doe:SUCCESS
ENROLL:12345:John Doe:PROGRESS:Step 2/3
ENROLL:12345:John Doe:FAILED:Poor quality
```

## 📊 Database Schema

### Enhanced Tables
```sql
-- Members table (enhanced)
ALTER TABLE members ADD COLUMN biometric_id TEXT UNIQUE;

-- Security logs
CREATE TABLE security_logs (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    event_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    timestamp TEXT NOT NULL,
    details TEXT,
    member_id INTEGER,
    device_id TEXT
);

-- Biometric events
CREATE TABLE biometric_events (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    member_id INTEGER,
    biometric_id TEXT,
    event_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    device_id TEXT,
    timestamp TEXT NOT NULL,
    success BOOLEAN NOT NULL,

```

## 🔧 Testing & Debugging

### Test Commands (Cross-Platform)
```bash
# Check if service is listening
npm run biometric:check

# Send comprehensive test messages
npm run biometric:test

# Get help for all available test options
npm run biometric:help
```

### Manual Testing
**Unix/macOS:**
```bash
# Manual test with netcat
echo "USER:12345:AUTHORIZED:TEST001" | nc localhost <BIOMETRIC_PORT>
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
# Manual test with PowerShell
$client = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TcpClient
$client.Connect("localhost", <BIOMETRIC_PORT>)
$stream = $client.GetStream()
$data = [System.Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetBytes("USER:12345:AUTHORIZED:TEST001`r`n")
$stream.Write($data, 0, $data.Length)
$client.Close()
```

**Note:** Replace `<BIOMETRIC_PORT>` with your configured port (from `.env` file)

### Common Issues & Solutions

**1. Device Not Connecting**
- ✅ Check network connectivity
- ✅ Verify firewall settings (check your `BIOMETRIC_PORT` in `.env`)
- ✅ Confirm device IP configuration
- ✅ Test with: `npm run biometric:check`

**2. Messages Not Processing**
- ✅ Check message format compatibility
- ✅ Verify biometric service is running
- ✅ Review console logs for errors
- ✅ Test with known good message format

**3. Members Not Found**
- ✅ Ensure biometric_id is set in database
- ✅ Check case sensitivity of IDs
- ✅ Verify device is sending correct user ID
- ✅ Review enrollment process completion

**4. Enrollment Failures**
- ✅ Check device enrollment mode
- ✅ Verify enrollment timeout settings
- ✅ Ensure member doesn't already have biometric data
- ✅ Check device-specific enrollment commands

## 📈 Performance Optimization

### Database Indexes
