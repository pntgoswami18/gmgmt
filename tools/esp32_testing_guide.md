- [ ] Vibration resistance (door slamming)
- [ ] Enclosure is waterproof (IP65 rated)

## 📡 Communication Testing

### WiFi Connectivity
- [ ] Connects to WiFi network reliably
- [ ] Auto-reconnects after network disruption
- [ ] Signal strength is adequate at installation location
- [ ] TCP connection to gym server is stable
- [ ] Heartbeat messages are sent regularly

### Message Protocol Testing
- [ ] JSON messages are properly formatted
- [ ] Fingerprint authentication messages reach server
- [ ] Server responds with appropriate acknowledgments
- [ ] Command messages from server are processed
- [ ] Error handling works for network failures

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Device appears in gym management dashboard
- [ ] Member fingerprint verification works end-to-end
- [ ] Attendance logging is accurate
- [ ] Remote unlock commands work
- [ ] Device status monitoring is real-time

## 🔐 Security Testing

### Access Control
- [ ] Only enrolled fingerprints grant access
- [ ] Unauthorized fingerprints are consistently rejected
- [ ] System locks out after multiple failed attempts
- [ ] Manual override requires physical button press
- [ ] Emergency unlock logs are created

### Data Security
- [ ] Fingerprint templates are stored securely on device
- [ ] Network communication uses appropriate encryption
- [ ] Device cannot be easily tampered with
- [ ] Factory reset clears all stored data
- [ ] Firmware updates are authenticated

## ⚡ Performance Testing

### Speed Benchmarks
- [ ] Fingerprint recognition: < 2 seconds
- [ ] Door unlock delay: < 1 second from recognition
- [ ] Network message transmission: < 500ms
- [ ] System startup time: < 30 seconds
- [ ] Web interface response: < 2 seconds

### Reliability Testing
- [ ] System runs continuously for 24 hours without issues
- [ ] No memory leaks during extended operation
- [ ] Handles 100+ authentication attempts per day
- [ ] Survives power interruptions gracefully
- [ ] WiFi disconnection recovery works

## 🧪 System Integration Testing

### End-to-End Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: New Member Enrollment
1. Admin starts enrollment from web dashboard
2. Member places finger on ESP32 sensor
3. Enrollment completes successfully
4. Member ID is linked to fingerprint template
5. Member can immediately access using fingerprint

#### Scenario 2: Daily Access
1. Member approaches door
2. Places finger on sensor
3. System recognizes fingerprint within 2 seconds
4. Door unlocks for 3 seconds
5. Attendance is logged in gym management system
6. Dashboard shows real-time access event

#### Scenario 3: Remote Control
1. Admin opens gym management dashboard
2. Views list of connected ESP32 devices
3. Sends remote unlock command to specific door
4. Door unlocks immediately
5. Action is logged with admin credentials

#### Scenario 4: Emergency Situations
1. Power failure occurs
2. System gracefully shuts down
3. Power is restored
4. System boots and reconnects automatically
5. All settings and enrollments are preserved

#### Scenario 5: Network Failure
1. WiFi network becomes unavailable
2. System continues working in offline mode
3. Access attempts are cached locally
4. Network reconnects automatically
5. Cached data is synchronized to server

## 📊 Load Testing

### High-Traffic Scenarios
- [ ] Handle 50 access attempts per hour
- [ ] Process simultaneous enrollment and authentication
- [ ] Maintain performance with 100+ enrolled fingerprints
- [ ] Network bandwidth usage remains reasonable
- [ ] Memory usage stays below 70% of available

### Stress Testing
- [ ] Rapid successive fingerprint scans (1 per second)
- [ ] Continuous network command sending
- [ ] Extended operation without reboots (7 days)
- [ ] Multiple device connections to same server
- [ ] Database handles large event logs (10,000+ entries)
